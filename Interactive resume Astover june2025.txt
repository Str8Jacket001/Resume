    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a fixed top navigation for easy access to distinct thematic sections: Home, Experience, Skills, and Publications. This structure was chosen to transform a linear resume into an interactive portfolio. The user can either scroll through a logical narrative or jump directly to the section of most interest. Key interactions include an expandable timeline for professional experience and a live-filterable grid for skills, enhancing usability and engagement far beyond a static document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Profile/Header -> Goal: Inform -> Presentation: Clean, high-impact text block -> Interaction: None -> Justification: Immediately establishes professional identity.
        - Professional Experience -> Goal: Organize/Change -> Viz: Vertical Interactive Timeline -> Interaction: On-click expansion of details -> Justification: Condenses a long history into a clean, interactive format that encourages exploration without overwhelming the user. Built with HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Key Competencies -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: Filterable Skill Grid -> Interaction: Live text search filters the grid -> Justification: Turns a dense table into a dynamic, user-driven tool for recruiters to quickly find relevant skills. Built with HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Publications/Honors -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Card-based grid -> Interaction: Clickable links on cards -> Justification: Modern, clean presentation for portfolio items.
        - No charts were used as the source data is qualitative.
